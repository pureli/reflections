Q.How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
by using git

Q.What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Git: can properly commit th size of those changes
google docs: because it commit automatically, so every tiny change will be commit. And the version will too much.

Q.Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git consider those changes in the same repository as a new version, no matter how many files changes. Because like google docs, it saves each file separately, sometimes we will be confused which file is the newest in the repository.

Q.How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
*List all the version: use 'git log' command
*Compare two version: use 'git diff A_ID B_ID' (A_ID is the previous, B_ID is the newest)
*Keep looking for the difference: press [enter] until see the next version
*Finish looking: press [q]

Q.How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
by using 'git checkout' command to access any version I want

Q.Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
