Q.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When co-work with oyher people.

Q.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because sometimes I need to wait oher people to update the file, then I could go on to work the other functions or revisions. So it is better to pull file from GitHub manually.

Q.Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
*forks: to copy file from other person's repository to my repository on GitHub.
*clones: to copy file from GitHub to mine local computer.
*branches: create another room for testing on local computer.

Q.What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
When other people revise the file and push it to GitHub, you can know the difference between your revisions and other people's revisions from the latest copy which already stored locally .

Q.How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
To copy the entire file to the collaborator. Although it is convenient whithout doing a lot of command, but it is harder to collaborate to other people immediatly. And also without a good version control.

Q.When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
When the master is working online, like official website. If the other branch's function is not finished, it can be saved in the specific branch, and won't affect the master branch.
