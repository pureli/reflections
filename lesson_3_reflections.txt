Q.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When co-work with oyher people.

Q.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because sometimes I need to wait oher people to update the file, then I could go on to work the other functions or revisions. So it is better to pull file from GitHub manually.

Q.Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
*forks: to copy file from other person's repository to my repository on GitHub.
*clones: to copy file from GitHub to mine local computer.
*branches: create another room for testing on local computer.
